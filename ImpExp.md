When Why and How we can do import export


Import
----> le lo
Export
----> bhej do

lets say 
import React from 'react'
----> React ko le lo KAHA SE react dependencies se

lets say
export default Main;
----> Main jo component hai us ko BHEJ DO kaha pe DEFAULT mtlb App.js k component me

What i did in this commit
made 2 file 
1st Main.js
2nd Main1.js
Main.js-----> react fun. component made 
Main1.js----> const created with Like and exported default Like to main file that is App.js
after that in App.js i imported that Like and Main.js component and pass it to retuen value
Like is const to export in App.js file we must need to pass an attribute
{} is in use to export the Like const
{Like } passed to the App.js
